# Visual Design Plan: Spritesheet Generator for Godot - DRAFT

## 1. Project Goals & User Personas

### 1.1. Project Goal
To create an intuitive and efficient web-based spritesheet generator that simplifies the 2D animation workflow for Godot game engine users, enabling them to quickly create and export character animations.

### 1.2. Target User Personas

*   **Persona 1: Indie Dev Alex**
    *   **Background:** Solo developer or small team member, proficient in Godot, but not a dedicated artist.
    *   **Needs:** Quickly create decent-looking placeholder or simple production-ready animations. Values efficiency and ease of use over complex artistic tools. Needs seamless Godot integration.
    *   **Pain Points:** Animation is time-consuming; struggles with consistency across frames/animations; existing tools might be too complex or not Godot-focused.
*   **Persona 2: Hobbyist Maria**
    *   **Background:** Learning game development with Godot in her spare time. Passionate about creating but may have limited artistic skills or budget for assets.
    *   **Needs:** A free or affordable tool that is easy to learn. Wants to bring her character ideas to life without a steep learning curve.
    *   **Pain Points:** Intimidated by professional art software; needs guidance (like templates) to get started.
*   **Persona 3: Student Sam**
    *   **Background:** Game design student working on projects.
    *   **Needs:** A tool to quickly prototype animations for game jams or assignments. May need to iterate rapidly.
    *   **Pain Points:** Tight deadlines; needs to produce varied animations quickly.

## 2. Brand Identity & Style Guide

### 2.1. Logo & Wordmark
*   **Concept:** [To be defined - e.g., A simple, modern icon representing a sprite or animation frames, combined with the text "Spritesheet Generator"]
*   **Variations:** [To be defined - e.g., Full color, monochrome, icon-only]

### 2.2. Color Palette
*   **Primary Colors:**
    *   `Primary Action Blue`: `#XXXXXX` (For main buttons, active states)
    *   `Primary Background`: `#XXXXXX` (Main app background - consider light/dark themes)
*   **Secondary Colors:**
    *   `Secondary Accent`: `#XXXXXX` (For secondary actions, highlights)
    *   `Canvas Background`: `#XXXXXX` (Neutral, non-distracting for drawing area)
*   **Accent Colors:**
    *   `Highlight/Call-to-Action`: `#XXXXXX`
*   **Neutrals:**
    *   `Text Default`: `#XXXXXX`
    *   `Text Subtle`: `#XXXXXX`
    *   `Border/Divider`: `#XXXXXX`
    *   `Panel Background`: `#XXXXXX`
*   **Semantic Colors:**
    *   `Success`: `#XXXXXX` (e.g., for export complete)
    *   `Error`: `#XXXXXX` (e.g., for template load fail)
    *   `Warning`: `#XXXXXX`
    *   `Info`: `#XXXXXX`
*   **Theme Considerations:** [Define separate palettes if light and dark themes are planned]

### 2.3. Typography

## 4. Screen Mockups & User Flows

### 4.1. User Flows
*   [List key user flows with brief descriptions or diagrams. Examples:]
    *   **Flow 1: Creating a New Spritesheet from Template:**
        1.  User lands on app.
        2.  Selects a template (e.g., "Walk").
        3.  Template loads on canvas.
        4.  User selects drawing tool (e.g., "Brush").
        5.  User selects color.
        6.  User draws character parts on canvas.
        7.  User clicks "Generate Animation Frames."
        8.  Animation preview updates.
        9.  User configures export settings.
        10. User clicks "Export."
    *   **Flow 2: Adding a New Custom Template:** (If this feature is prioritized)
    *   **Flow 3: Editing an Existing Animation Frame:** (Future Enhancement)

### 4.2. Wireframes (Low-fidelity)
*   [Sketches or simple digital layouts for each main screen/view, focusing on structure and content hierarchy. One for:]
    *   Main Application Interface (showing all panels)
    *   Export Settings Modal
    *   Error/Success Notification Toasts/Modals

### 4.3. High-fidelity Mockups

    *   **Main App View - Template Loaded:** (Canvas showing template guides, part labels)
    *   **Main App View - Drawing Active:** (Showing tool properties, active tool highlighted)
    *   **Main App View - Animation Preview Active:** (Showing playback controls, frame scrubber)
    *   **Export Settings Modal:** (All options visible)
    *   **Template Selector Dropdown - Open State:**
    *   **Error State Example:** (e.g., Template load error message displayed)

### 4.4. Interactive Prototypes
*   [Link to or description of clickable prototypes (e.g., Figma, Adobe XD) demonstrating key user flows and interactions.]

## 5. Interaction Design & Animations

*   **General Principles:** [e.g., Responsive feedback, clear visual cues, minimal friction]
*   **Tool Selection:** Visual feedback for active tool.
*   **Canvas Interactions:**
    *   Cursor changes for different tools.
    *   Visual feedback during drawing (e.g., brush preview).
*   **Panel Transitions:** [e.g., How panels appear/disappear or resize, if applicable]
*   **Modal Animations:** [e.g., Fade-in, slide-up]
*   **Loading States:** Clear visual indication of background processes (template loading, animation generation).
*   **Drag and Drop (if applicable for layers/frames):** Visual cues for draggable items and drop targets.

## 6. Accessibility (A11y) Guidelines

*   **Color Contrast:** Ensure all text and meaningful UI elements meet WCAG AA contrast ratios.
*   **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements must be focusable and operable via keyboard.
    *   Define logical focus order.
*   **ARIA Attributes:** Specify necessary ARIA roles, states, and properties for custom components (e.g., tool panel, canvas elements if they are not inherently accessible).
*   **Alternative Text:** For icons that convey meaning, ensure tooltips or ARIA labels provide text alternatives.
*   **Focus Indicators:** Clear and visible focus indicators for all focusable elements.
*   **Semantic HTML:** Use appropriate HTML5 elements for structure.

## 7. Specific View Designs

### 7.1. Canvas View
*   **Template Rendering:**
    *   Outline style (color, thickness, dash pattern if any).
    *   Fill style (color, opacity).
    *   Part label appearance (font, background, positioning).
    *   Visual distinction for "active" part being drawn on (if applicable).
*   **Drawing Feedback:**
    *   Brush cursor appearance.
    *   Line preview while drawing.
*   **Layer Panel (if implemented):**
    *   Layer item appearance (name, visibility toggle, active state).
    *   Drag-and-drop interaction visuals.

### 7.2. Tool Panel
*   **Layout:** Organization of tools and their properties.
*   **Tool Button States:** (Selected, unselected, hover).
*   **Property Controls:** Visual design for brush size slider, color picker integration.

### 7.3. Template Selector
*   **Dropdown Appearance:**
    *   List item style (text, potential for future thumbnails).
    *   Selected item display.
*   **Loading/Error States:** Visual feedback within the selector or adjacent to it.

### 7.4. Animation Preview Panel
