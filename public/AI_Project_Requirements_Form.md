**Hello Future Developer!**

This form is designed to help you think through your project idea and gather all the necessary details. Providing this information to an AI (like me!) will help it understand your vision and assist you in creating a development plan, suggesting technologies, and even generating initial code prompts. [UPDATED]

**Instructions:**
*   Be as detailed as you can. The more information, the better!
*   Don't worry about technical jargon. Explain things in your own words.
*   Think of this as a conversation with a very helpful assistant who wants to bring your idea to life.
*   Skip any questions that don't seem relevant to your project.
